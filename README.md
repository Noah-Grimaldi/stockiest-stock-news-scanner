# Stockiest-StockNewsScanner

**DESCRIPTION** - This is a scanner I created that only tells you the good stock news and filters out the assumed irrelevant news based on keywords. This project is designed to make a get request to newsfilterio site and scan the most updated stock news with a list of keywords that are typical among important stock news. I used python for the webscraping because of its easy initiation process. One challenge I faced was trying to find the hidden API that newsfilter was getting their main information from.

**INSTALLATION** - simply download the folder, open the folder, run the exe file and be sure that the mp3 file is inside the folder as well.

**IMPORTANT** - This screener will not always find news especially because of the extremely narrowed down keywords. The most important stock news will typically occur around 9:30-10:30 a.m. (E.T.)

**HOW TO USE** - You can use this project by downloading the files, navigating to the exe file and running it. Hit "start filtering;" the program scans for any important news based on the keywords and notifies the user in the multiline box after it is found. You can pause the program or stop it. (stopping the program closes the entire thing.)
